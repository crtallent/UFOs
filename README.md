# UFOs

## Overview of UFOs Project

For this task, we created a webpge with a dynamic title that allows visitors to filter UFO sighting results based on a variety of criteria.  This page currently offers a wealth of information for sightings between January 1, 2010 and January 13, 2010.  Information has been compiled from around the world and even has narrative describing the incidents as comments.  The following search criteria can be filtered for each sigthing:

* Date 
* City 
* State
* Country
* Shape of Object

The webpage can be accessed via this [link](https://crtallent.github.io/UFOs/).

## UFO Analysis Results

This webpage is a user-friendly application with multiple fields that users can filter through to gather specific results.  Placeholders are in place in the text field box to indicate how the search should be entered. For example, upon loading the page, the user can use the "Enter Date" field to filter through all sighting on the specified date.  The user will simply type the date into the form field and by hitting enter, all of the results for that particular date will be selected in the table to the right of their selection:

Likewise, if the user is interested in seeing all sightings for a given state, they will type in the state's abbreviation to filter the table to show only the sightings for that particular state:
