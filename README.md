## Overview of UFOs Analysis

For this task, we created a webpge with a dynamic title that allows visitors to filter UFO sighting results based on a variety of criteria.  This page currently offers a wealth of information for sightings between January 1, 2010 and January 13, 2010.  Information has been compiled from around the world and even has narrative describing the incidents as comments.  The following search criteria can be filtered for each sigthing:

* Date 
* City 
* State
* Country
* Shape of Object

The webpage can be accessed via this [link] (https://crtallent.github.io/UFOs/) .
